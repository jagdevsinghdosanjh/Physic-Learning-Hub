# Laws of Motion

Newtonâ€™s laws describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it.

## Key Concepts
- **First Law**: Inertiaâ€”an object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon.
- **Second Law**: \( F = ma \)â€”force equals mass times acceleration.
- **Third Law**: Action and reaction are equal and opposite.

## Friction
- Static and kinetic friction
- Factors affecting friction

## Circular Motion
- Centripetal force
- Banking of roads
