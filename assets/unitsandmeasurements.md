## 📚 1. Introduction to Measurement
Measurement is the comparison of an unknown quantity with a known standard. Physics relies on precise measurements to describe natural phenomena.

## 🧪 2. Fundamental and Derived Units

### 🔹 Fundamental Quantities (SI Base Units)
| Quantity             | Unit     | Symbol |
|----------------------|----------|--------|
| Length               | metre    | m      |
| Mass                 | kilogram | kg     |
| Time                 | second   | s      |
| Temperature          | kelvin   | K      |
| Electric Current     | ampere   | A      |
| Luminous Intensity   | candela  | cd     |
| Amount of Substance  | mole     | mol    |

### 🔸 Derived Units
Examples include:
- Velocity: m/s
- Acceleration: m/s²
- Force: newton (N) = kg·m/s²

## 📐 3. Dimensional Analysis

### ✅ Applications
- Checking correctness of equations
- Converting units
- Deriving relationships

### 🧮 Example
Check if the equation \( v = u + at \) is dimensionally correct:

- \( [v] = [u] = LT^{-1} \)
- \( [a] = LT^{-2}, [t] = T \)
- So \( [at] = LT^{-2} \cdot T = LT^{-1} \)

✅ Dimensions match → equation is valid.

## 📊 4. Accuracy, Precision & Errors

### 🔍 Types of Errors
- **Systematic Error**: Consistent bias (e.g., faulty instrument)
- **Random Error**: Varies unpredictably
- **Gross Error**: Human mistakes

### 📈 Error Estimation
- Absolute Error: \( \Delta x = |x_{\text{measured}} - x_{\text{true}}| \)
- Relative Error: \( \frac{\Delta x}{x_{\text{true}}} \)
- Percentage Error: \( \frac{\Delta x}{x_{\text{true}}} \times 100\% \)

## 🧩 5. Significant Figures

- Reflect precision of measurement.
- Rules:
  - All non-zero digits are significant.
  - Zeros between significant digits are significant.
  - Trailing zeros in decimal are significant.

### ✏️ Example
- 0.00450 → 3 significant figures  
- 1200 → 2 significant figures (unless specified)
