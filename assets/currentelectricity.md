# Current Electricity

Current electricity deals with the flow of electric charge in conductors.

## Key Concepts
- **Electric Current**: Rate of flow of charge \( I = \frac{Q}{t} \)
- **Ohmâ€™s Law**: \( V = IR \)
- **Resistance**: Opposition to current flow
- **Kirchhoffâ€™s Laws**: Junction and loop rules

## Applications
- Series and parallel circuits
- Internal resistance of cells
