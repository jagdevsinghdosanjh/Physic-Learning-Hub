# Optics

Optics is the study of light and its interactions with matter.

## Key Concepts
- **Reflection**: Angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.
- **Refraction**: Bending of light due to change in medium.
- **Lens Formula**: \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} \)

## Wave Optics
- Interference and diffraction
- Young‚Äôs double-slit experiment

## Optical Instruments
- Microscope and telescope
