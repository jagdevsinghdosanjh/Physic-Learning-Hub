# Kinematics

Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that describes the motion of objects without considering the causes of motion.

## Key Concepts
- **Displacement**: Vector quantity representing change in position.
- **Velocity**: Rate of change of displacement.
- **Acceleration**: Rate of change of velocity.

## Equations of Motion (for constant acceleration)
- \( v = u + at \)
- \( s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \)
- \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \)

## Graphical Representations
- Displacement-Time Graph
- Velocity-Time Graph

## Quiz Questions
1. What does the slope of a velocity-time graph represent?
2. If a car accelerates from 0 to 20 m/s in 5 seconds, what is its acceleration?
3. Which equation gives displacement when acceleration is constant?
