# Work, Energy & Power

This unit deals with the concepts of mechanical work, energy transformations, and power.

## Key Concepts
- **Work**: \( W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos\theta \)
- **Energy**: Capacity to do work—kinetic and potential energy.
- **Power**: Rate of doing work \( P = \frac{W}{t} \)

## Work-Energy Theorem
- Net work done equals change in kinetic energy.

## Collisions
- Elastic and inelastic collisions
- Conservation of momentum
