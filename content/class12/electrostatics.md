# Electrostatics

Electrostatics is the study of electric charges at rest.

## Key Concepts
- **Charge**: Fundamental property—positive or negative.
- **Coulomb’s Law**: \( F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \)
- **Electric Field**: Region around a charge where force is experienced.
- **Electric Potential**: Work done in bringing a unit charge.

## Capacitors
- Capacitance and energy storage
- Series and parallel combinations
